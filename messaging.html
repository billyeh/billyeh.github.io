    <h1>Is anyone else buried under a mountain of text messaging platforms?</h1>
    <h2>The Mountain ðŸ—»</h2>
    <p>
      First you have Facebook <b>Messenger</b>, for the boomer generation and friends from school and church.
      On Messenger, not only do you have DMs, but you have group messages.
      Let's say you happen to be in a 30 person group.
      It might've started out small, maybe five or so people.
      After while, it started growing.
      Friends added friends, and life happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you have a 30 person group.
      But that's a minor issue, compared to what comes next.
      Imagine planning an event, but only half of the group is interested.
      You'll need to make another group, with just those 15 people, to avoid spamming the rest of the people.
      Before you know it, someone else will be planning another event.
      This time, 10 out of 30 people are interested.
      You know the drill.
      The absurdity of this situation is easily apparent to anyone who tries the math.
      (30 choose 5) works about to just about 142506 different groups.
      And that's just the number of possibilities with five-person groups :) 
      (The math for the number of possible groups without restricting to a certain group size is left to the aspiring and interested reader.)
    </p>
    <p>The same thing happens with <b>Whatsapp</b>.</p>
    <p>Then you download <b>Discord</b>, since that's what younger folks and gamers use.</p>
    <p>You probably have <b>Slack</b> still installed because some official organization wanted to use it back when it was cool.</p>
    <p>Before you know it, you have <b>WeChat</b> and <b>Line</b> as well.</p>
    <p>
      Oh, and <b>Google Chat</b> exhibits the same exact issues as Messenger, except that it's work-related topics onlyâ€“except for those groups and DMs that you use to chat about casual topics.
      Sometimes, the messages delete themselves after 24 hours.
      Sometimes, Chat keeps them for 30 days.
      Sometimes, that setting switches back and forth.
      Sometimes, Google seems to want to integrate Chat with GMail.
      Sometimes, Google will release another Chat app (see Allo, Duo, Meet, Messages, Voice).
      Sometimes, Google will kill those apps.
      Sometimes, Google will add messaging to existing apps (Docs, Pay, Photos).
      I love it.
    </p>
    <p>We're still just getting started.</p>
    <p>
      Obviously, in order to enforce more boundaries between your personal and work life, you need <b>LinkedIn</b>.
      LinkedIn has a wonderful messaging experience that, just like all the other apps above, asks you to download the app in order to use it more effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's not even get started with <b>Twitter</b>, <b>Instagram</b>, and <b>Reddit</b>.
      Luckily, I'm not cool enough to be using those actively.
      Although because I don't live under a rock, I do get prompted multiple times a day to do so.
      Here's to others out there who are fighting the losing battle and holding out from selling out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, no discussion of messaging would be complete without <b>iMessage</b>, with its exclusive little reactions (well, until they started showing up properly for Android <b>Messages</b>), sign-in, hardware and platform.
      Hey, you never know, maybe it'll come in handy when interacting with someone who's too tech-illiterate to use anything else.
    </p>
    <p>I'm sure things like <b>Youtube</b> and <b>Twitch</b> have their own little systems of comments and notifications and messaging.</p>
    <h2>But why?</h2>
    <p>
      It's hardly worth speculating why we're all buried under our own mountain or hill of messages and comments.
      Behind this combinatorial explosion of messaging apps, messages, and people is a set of perverse incentives.
      I'm not attempting to demonize any person or company, but it's a fact that the more engagement an app or website has, the more value it has to business interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those little messages, with their addictive little sounds, animations, and content, have been fine-tuned over the last decade.
      Thousands of engineers, data scientists, UX researchers, advertisers, and goodness knows how many more people, have been hard at work tuning them.
      The dopamine hits from each notification are undeniable.
      Companies have spent billions of dollars optimizing their UX and content to drag consumers into these apps and websites.
      A company that actively tries to reduce the time a consumer spends on their platform, is a bankrupt company.

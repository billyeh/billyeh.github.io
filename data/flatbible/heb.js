For if the word spoken through angels proved firm and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense,  How shall we escape if we have neglected so great a salvation, which, having had its beginning in being spoken by the Lord, has been confirmed to us by those who heard,  God bearing witness with them both by signs and wonders and by various works of power and by distributions of the Holy Spirit according to His will? "}, {"type": "outline", "text": "2. As the Son of Man -- As Man\n"}, {"type": "verse", "text": " For it was not to angels that He subjected the coming inhabited earth, concerning which we speak.  But one has solemnly testified somewhere, saying, \"What is man, that You bring him to mind? Or the son of man, that You care for him?  You have made Him a little inferior to the angels; You have crowned Him with glory and honor and have set Him over the works of Your hands;  You have subjected all things under His feet.'' For in subjecting all things to Him, He left nothing unsubject to Him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to Him,  But we see Jesus, who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death on behalf of everything.  For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.  For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers,  Saying, \"I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the church I will sing hymns of praise to You.''  And again, \"I will trust in Him.'' And again, \"Behold, I and the children whom God has given to Me.''  Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil,  And might release those who because of the fear of death through all their life were held in slavery.  For assuredly it is not to angels that He gives help, but He gives help to the seed of Abraham.  Hence He should have been made like His brothers in all things that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in the things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.  For being tempted in that which He Himself has suffered, He is able to help those who are being tempted. "}, {"type": "outline", "text": "B.

For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by as much as He who built the house has more honor than the house.  For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God.  And Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken later;  But Christ was faithful as a Son over His house, whose house we are if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end.

Therefore I was displeased with this generation, and I said, They always go astray in their heart, and they have not known My ways;  As I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest!''  Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief in falling away from the living God.  But exhort one another each day, as long as it is called \"today,'' lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.  For we have become partners of Christ, if indeed we hold fast the beginning of the assurance firm to the end,  While it is said, \"Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the provocation.''  For who provoked Him when they heard? Indeed was it not all who came out of Egypt by Moses?  And with whom was He displeased for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?  And to whom did He swear that they should not enter into His rest, except to the disobedient?  And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.  Let us fear therefore, lest, a promise being left of entering into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it.  For indeed we have had the good news announced to us, even as they also; but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed together with faith in those who heard.  For we who have believed enter into the rest, even as He has said, \"As I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest!'' although the works of creation were completed from the foundation of the world.  For He has spoken somewhere concerning the seventh day thus, \"And God rested on the seventh day from all His works.''  And in this place again, \"They shall not enter into My rest!''  Since therefore it remains that some should enter into it and those who formerly had the good news announced to them did not enter because of disobedience,  He again designates a certain day, today, saying in David after so long a time, even as He has said before, \"Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.''  For if Joshua had brought them into rest, He would not have spoken concerning another day after these things.  So then there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.  For he who has entered into His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His own.  Let us therefore be diligent to enter into that rest lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.  For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.  And there is no creature that is not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we are to give our account. "}, {"type": "outline", "text": "C. Superior to Aaron\n1. A High Priest\naccording to the Order of Melchisedec\n"}, {"type": "verse", "text": " Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession.  For we do not have a High Priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all respects like us, yet without sin.  Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help.  For every high priest, being taken from among men, is established on behalf of men in the things pertaining to God that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.  He is able to exercise compassion toward the ignorant and erring since he also is encompassed with weakness;  And because of it, he ought, even as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.  And no one takes the honor upon himself, but only as he is called by God, just as Aaron also was.  So also Christ did not glorify Himself in becoming a High Priest, but it was He who said to Him, \"You are My Son; this day have I begotten You'';  Even as also in another place He says, \"You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec.''  This One, in the days of His flesh, having offered up both petitions and supplications with strong crying and tears to Him who was able to save Him out of death and having been heard because of His piety,  Even though He was a Son, learned obedience from the things which He suffered.  And having been perfected, He became to all those who obey Him the source of eternal salvation,  Being addressed by God as a High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec; "}, {"type": "outline", "text": "(The Third Warning --\nBe Brought On to Maturity\n)"}, {"type": "verse", "text": " Concerning whom we have much to say that is also difficult to interpret since you have become dull of hearing.  For when because of the time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you what the rudiments of the beginning of the oracles of God are and have become those who have need of milk and not of solid food.  For everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness, for he is an infant;  But solid food is for the full-grown, who because of practice have their faculties exercised for discriminating between both good and evil.  Therefore leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us be brought on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith in God,  Of the teaching of baptisms and of the laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment.  And this we will do if God permits.  For it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit  And have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,  And yet have fallen away, to renew themselves again unto repentance, crucifying again for themselves the Son of God and putting Him to open shame.  For the earth, which drinks the rain which often comes upon it and produces vegetation suitable to those for whose sake also it is cultivated, partakes of blessing from God.  But if it brings forth thorns and thistles, it is disapproved and near a curse, whose end is to be burned.  But we are persuaded of better things concerning you, beloved, and things which belong to salvation, though we speak thus.  For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name in having ministered to the saints and in ministering still.  But we desire earnestly that each of you show the same diligence unto the full assurance of our hope until the end,  That you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and long-suffering are inheriting the promises.  For God, when He made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, swore by Himself,  Saying, \"Surely blessing, I will bless you; and multiplying, I will multiply you.''  And thus when Abraham had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.  For men swear by the greater, and for all disputes among them an oath is final for confirmation.  Therefore God, intending to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His counsel, interposed with an oath,  In order that by two unchangeable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we may have strong encouragement, we who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us,  Which we have as an anchor of the soul, both secure and firm and which enters within the veil,  Where the Forerunner, Jesus, has entered for us, having become forever a High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec. "}, {"type": "outline", "text": "2. A High Priest,\nPerpetual, Great, Living,\nand Able to Save to the Uttermost\n"}, {"type": "verse", "text": " For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,  To whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all; first being interpreted king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace;  Being without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually.  And consider how great this one was, to whom the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the choice spoils.  And they of the sons of Levi, who received the priestly service, have a commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, though they have come forth from the loins of Abraham.  But he whose genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes from Abraham and has blessed him who has the promises.  But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.  And here men, who die, receive tithes; but there, one of whom it is testified that he lives.  And, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi also, he who receives tithes, has been made to pay tithes,  For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him.  If indeed then perfection were through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what need was there still that a different Priest should arise according to the order of Melchisedec and that He should not be said to be according to the order of Aaron?  For since the priesthood is transferred, of necessity there comes into being a transfer of law also.  For He of whom these things are said belongs to a different tribe, from which no one has attended to the altar.  For it is evident that our Lord has risen out of Judah, concerning which tribe Moses spoke nothing about priests.  And it is still more abundantly evident since it is according to the likeness of Melchisedec that a different Priest arises,  Who has been appointed not according to the law of a fleshy commandment but according to the power of an indestructible life.  For it is testified, \"You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec.''  For there is, on the one hand, the setting aside of the preceding commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness  (For the law perfected nothing), and, on the other hand, the bringing in thereupon of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.  And inasmuch as He was not made a Priest without the taking of an oath  (For they are appointed priests without the taking of an oath, but He, with the taking of an oath by Him who said to Him, \"The Lord has sworn and will not regret it, You are a Priest forever''),  By so much Jesus has also become the surety of a better covenant.  And they are appointed priests many in number because death prevents them from continuing;  But He, because He abides forever, has His priesthood unalterable.  Hence also He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them.  For such a High Priest was also fitting to us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners and having become higher than the heavens,  Who does not have daily need, as the high priests do, to offer up sacrifices first for his own sins and then for those of the people; for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.  For the law establishes men as high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath, which was after the law, establishes the Son, perfected forever. "}, {"type": "outline", "text": "D. Christ's New Covenant\nSuperior to the Old\n1. A Better Covenant of Better Promises\nwith a More Excellent Ministry\n"}, {"type": "verse", "text": " Now in the things which are being said the chief point is this: We have such a High Priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,  A Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.  For every high priest is established for the offering of both gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary that this One also have something which He may offer.  Now then if He were on earth, He would not be a Priest at all, there being those who offer the gifts according to the law,  Who serve the example and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to complete the tabernacle; for, \"See,'' He said, \"that you make all things according to the pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.''  But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry inasmuch as He is also the Mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted upon better promises.  For if that first covenant had been faultless, no place would have been sought for a second.  For finding fault with them He says, \"Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah,  Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.  For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind, and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me.  And they shall by no means each teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all will know Me from the little one to the great one among them.  For I will be propitious to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins I shall by no means remember anymore.''  In saying, A new covenant, He has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and growing decrepit is near to disappearing. "}, {"type": "outline", "text": "2. Better Sacrifices and Better Blood\nwith the Greater and More Perfect Tabernacle\n"}, {"type": "verse", "text": " Now then the first covenant also had ordinances of service, and its sanctuary was of this world.  For a tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which were the lampstand and the table and the loaves that were set forth, which is called the Holy Place;  And after the second veil, a tabernacle, which is called the Holy of Holies,  Having a golden altar and the ark of the covenant covered about everywhere with gold, in which were the golden pot that had the manna and Aaron's rod that budded and the tablets of the covenant,  And above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the propitiation place, concerning which it is not now the time to speak in detail.  Now these things having been thus prepared, into the first tabernacle the priests enter continually, accomplishing their worship;  But into the second, only the high priest enters, once a year and not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of ignorance of the people,  The Holy Spirit thus making this clear, that the way of the Holy of Holies has not yet been manifested while the first tabernacle still has its standing,  Which is a figure for the present time. According to this tabernacle both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which are unable to perfect, according to conscience, him who worships,  Consisting only of foods and drinks and various washings, being ordinances of the flesh, imposed until the time of setting things right.  But Christ, having come as a High Priest of the good things that have come into being, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made by hands, that is, not of this creation,  And not through the blood of goats and calves but through His own blood, entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, obtaining an eternal redemption.  For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who are defiled sanctify to the purity of the flesh,  How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?  And because of this He is the Mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those who have been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.  For where there is a testament, the death of him who made the testament must of necessity be established.  For a testament is confirmed in the case of the dead, since it never has force when he who made the testament is living.  Hence neither was the first covenant initiated without blood;  For when every commandment according to the law had been spoken by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll of the covenant itself and all the people,  Saying, \"This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded to you.''  And both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service he sprinkled in like manner with the blood.  And almost all things are purified by blood according to the law, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.  It was necessary therefore for the examples of the things in the heavens to be purified by these, but the heavenly things themselves, by better sacrifices than these.  For Christ did not enter into a holy place made by hands, a figure of the true, but into heaven itself, to appear now before the face of God for us;  Nor in order that He might offer Himself often, just as the high priest enters into the Holy of Holies year by year by the blood of other creatures;  Since then He would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself.  And inasmuch as it is reserved for men to die once, and after this comes judgment,  So Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time to those who eagerly await Him, apart from sin, unto salvation.  For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, not the image itself of the things, can never by the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, perfect those who draw near.  Otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered, because those worshipping, having once been purified, would have no longer had the consciousness of sins?  But in those sacrifices there is a bringing to mind of sins year by year;  For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.  Therefore, coming into the world, He says, \"Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me.  In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You did not delight.  Then I said, Behold, I have come (in the roll of the book it is written concerning Me) to do Your will, O God.''  Saying above, \"Sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You did not desire nor delight in'' (which are offered according to the law),  He then has said, \"Behold, I have come to do Your will.'' He takes away the first that He may establish the second,  By which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.  And every priest stands daily, ministering and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never remove sins;  But this One, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down forever on the right hand of God,  Henceforth waiting until His enemies are made the footstool for His feet.  For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.  And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after having said,  \"This is the covenant which I will covenant with them after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws upon their hearts, and upon their mind I will inscribe them,''  He then says, \"And their sins and their lawlessnesses I shall by no means remember anymore.''  Now where forgiveness of these is, there is no longer an offering for sin.

Let us hold fast the confession of our hope unwavering, for He who has promised is faithful;  And let us consider one another so as to incite one another to love and good works,  Not abandoning our own assembling together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.  For when we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice of bulls and goats for sins,  But a certain fearful expectation of judgment and fervor of fire, which is to consume the adversaries.  Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without compassion on the testimony of two or three witnesses.  By how much do you think he will be thought worthy of worse punishment who has trampled underfoot the Son of God and has considered the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing and has insulted the Spirit of grace?  For we know Him who said, \"Vengeance is Mine; I will repay''; and again, \"The Lord will judge His people.''  It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  But call to mind the former days, in which, having been enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings;  On one hand, being made a spectacle both in reproaches and in afflictions, and on the other, having become partakers with those who are treated the same.  For you both sympathized with those in bonds and accepted with joy the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you yourselves have a better possession and one that abides.  Do not cast away therefore your boldness, which has great reward.  For you have need of endurance in order that, having done the will of God, you may obtain the promise.  \"For in yet a very little while the Coming One will come and will not delay.

By faith we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God, so that what is seen has not come into being out of things which appear.  By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying to his gifts; and through faith, though he has died, he still speaks.  By faith Enoch was translated so that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God had translated him. For before his translation he obtained the testimony that he had been well pleasing to God.  But without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to Him, for he who comes forward to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.  By faith Noah, having been divinely instructed concerning things not yet seen and being moved by pious fear, prepared an ark for the salvation of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.  By faith Abraham, being called, obeyed to go out unto a place which he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going.  By faith he dwelt as a foreigner in the land of promise as in a foreign land, making his home in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the fellow heirs of the same promise;  For he eagerly waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God.  By faith also Sarah herself received power to conceive seed, even beyond the season of age, since she considered Him faithful who promised.  Therefore also there were born of one, and that of him who had become dead, as many as even the stars of heaven in multitude and as the sand by the seashore innumerable.  All these died in faith, not receiving the promises but seeing them from afar and joyfully greeting them and confessing that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth.  For those who say such things make it manifest that they seek after a country of their own.  And if indeed they continued to remember that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return;  But as it is, they long after a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.  By faith Abraham, being tested, offered up Isaac; indeed he who gladly received the promises was offering up his only begotten,  Of whom it was said, \"In Isaac shall your seed be called'';  Counting that God was able to raise men even from the dead, from which he also received him back in figure.  By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.  By faith Jacob, while he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshipped God, while leaning on the top of his staff.  By faith Joseph, nearing his end, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel and gave orders concerning his bones.  By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents because they saw that the child was lovely, and they did not fear the king's decree.  By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,  Choosing rather to be ill treated with the people of God than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin,  Considering the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked away to the reward.  By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king, for he persevered as one seeing the unseen One.  By faith he instituted the Passover and the pouring out of the blood so that the one destroying the firstborn would not touch them.  By faith they passed through the Red Sea as through dry land, in which the Egyptians, while making the attempt, were swallowed up.  By faith the walls of Jericho fell, having been encircled for a period of seven days.  By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who were disobedient, since she had received the spies with peace.  And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets,  Who through faith overcame kingdoms, worked righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,  Quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong in weakness, became mighty in war, routed the armies of foreigners.  Women received their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured to death, not accepting deliverance, in order that they might obtain a better resurrection.  And still others underwent the trial of mockings and scourgings, even, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment.  They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they died by the murder of the sword, they wandered about in sheepskins, in goatskins, destitute, afflicted, ill treated  (Of whom the world was not worthy), wandering over deserts and mountains and in caves and holes of the earth.  And these all, having obtained a good testimony through their faith, did not obtain the promise,  Because God has provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.

It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons. For what son is there whom the father does not discipline?  But if you are without discipline, of which all sons have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons.  Furthermore we have had the fathers of our flesh as discipliners and we respected them; shall we not much more be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?  For they disciplined for a few days as it seemed good to them; but He, for what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness.  Now no discipline at the present time seems to be a matter of joy, but of grief; but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it.  Therefore set straight the hands which hang down and the paralyzed knees,  And make straight paths for your feet, that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather may be healed.  Pursue peace with all men and sanctification, without which no one will see the Lord;  Looking carefully lest anyone fall away from the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and through this many be defiled;  Lest there be any fornicator or profane person like Esau, who for one meal gave up his own birthright.  For you know that also afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for repentance, even though he sought it with tears.  For you have not come forward to a mountain which could be touched and which was set on fire, and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind,  And to the sound of a trumpet and to the voice of words, because of which those who heard entreated that no further word be spoken to them;  For they could not bear that which was being commanded: \"If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned.''  And so fearful was the sight, Moses said, \"I am full of fear and trembling.''  But you have come forward to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem; and to myriads of angels, to the universal gathering;  And to the church of the firstborn, who have been enrolled in the heavens; and to God, the Judge of all; and to the spirits of righteous men who have been made perfect;  And to Jesus, the Mediator of a new covenant; and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks something better than that of Abel.  See that you do not refuse Him who speaks, for if those did not escape who refused Him who warned them upon the earth, much more we shall not escape who turn away from Him who warns from heaven,  Whose voice at that time shook the earth but now has promised, saying, \"Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also heaven.''  And this word, \"Yet once more,'' shows clearly the removal of the things being shaken as being of things having been made, that the things which are not shaken may remain.  Therefore receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly with piety and fear;  For our God is also a consuming fire.

Do not forget hospitality, for through this some, without knowing it, have entertained angels.  Remember those who are imprisoned as bound with them, those who are ill treated as being yourselves also likewise treated in body.  Let marriage be held in honor among all, and the bed undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.  Let your way of life be without the love of money, being satisfied with the things which are at hand; for He Himself has said, \"I shall by no means give you up, neither by any means shall I abandon you'';  So that being of good courage, we say, \"The Lord is my Helper, and I will not fear. What shall man do to me?''  Remember the ones leading you, who have spoken to you the word of God; and considering the issue of their manner of life, imitate their faith.

Do not be carried away by various strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to be confirmed by grace, not by the food of sacrifices, by which those who walk were not profited.  We have an altar from which they who are serving the tabernacle have no right to eat.  For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the Holy of Holies for sin by the high priest are burned up outside the camp.  Therefore also Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate.  Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.  For we do not have here a remaining city, but we seek after the one to come.  Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, the fruit of lips confessing His name. "}, {"type": "outline", "text": "C.

Obey the ones leading you and submit to them, for they watch over your souls as those who will render an account, that they may do this with joy and not groaning; for this would be unprofitable to you.  Pray for us, for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring in all things to conduct ourselves honorably.

Amen.  Now I beseech you, brothers, bear with the word of this exhortation; for indeed I have written to you in few words.  Know that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom, if he comes soon, I will see you.  Greet all the ones leading you and all the saints. Those from Italy greet you.  Grace be with you all.

For the overseer must be unreprovable as a steward of God, not self-willed, not quick tempered, not an excessive drinker, not a striker, not greedy for base gain;  But hospitable, a lover of good, of a sober mind, righteous, holy, self-controlled;  Holding to the faithful word, which is according to the teaching of the apostles, that he may be able both to exhort by the healthy teaching and to convict those who oppose.

One from among themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.  This testimony is true; for which cause reprove them severely that they may be healthy in the faith,  Not paying attention to Jewish myths and the commandments of men who turn away from the truth.  All things are pure to the pure; yet to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.  They profess to know God, but by their works they deny Him, being abominable and disobedient and, as to every good work, disapproved. "}, {"type": "outline", "text": "IV.

Exhort older men to be temperate, grave, of a sober mind, healthy in faith, in love, in endurance;  Older women likewise to be in demeanor as befits those who engage in sacred things, not slanderers, nor enslaved by much wine, teachers of what is good,  That they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,  To be of a sober mind, pure, workers at home, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God would not be blasphemed.  The younger men likewise exhort to be of a sober mind,  Concerning all things presenting yourself as a pattern of good works: in your teaching showing incorruption, gravity,  Healthy speech that cannot be condemned, that he who opposes may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us.

For the grace of God, bringing salvation to all men, has appeared,  Training us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in the present age,  Awaiting the blessed hope, even the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,  Who gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify to Himself a particular people as His unique possession, zealous of good works.

For we also were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving as slaves various lusts and pleasures, spending our lives in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.  But when the kindness and the love to man of our Savior God appeared,  Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit,  Whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,  In order that having been justified by His grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.  Faithful is the word, and concerning these things I desire you to confidently affirm, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to maintain respectable works.

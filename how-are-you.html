    <p>If you're asking me how I am via text message, I have to assume one of two things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You're trying to actually know how I am.</li>
      <li>You're just asking me that question as a preface to another, actual request or question.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Of course, there's a third option, which is so illogical that there's no way it would make any sense whatsoever.
      You could be asking how I am, kind of like how Americans tend to do that in person, where the de facto answer is "Good!" or "Doing well."
      I hope no one ever does this because <a href="https://github.com/billyeh/billyeh.github.io/blob/master/communication.html">texting is already such a bad way to communicate.</a>

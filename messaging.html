Is anyone else buried under a mountain of text messaging platforms?

<p>
  First you have Facebook <b>Messenger</b>, for the boomer generation and friends from school and church.
  On Messenger, not only do you have DMs, but you have group messages.
  Let's say you happen to be in a 30 person group.
  It might've started out small, maybe five or so people.
  After while, it started growing.
  Friends added friends, and life happens.

  Now you have a 30 person group.
  But that's a minor issue, compared to what comes next.
  Imagine planning an event, but only half of the group is interested.
  You'll need to make another group, with just those 15 people, to avoid spamming the rest of the people.
  Before you know it, someone else will be planning another event.
  This time, 10 out of 30 people are interested.
  You know the drill.
  The absurdity of this situation is easily apparent to anyone who tries the math.
  (30 choose 5) works about to just about 142506 different groups.
  And that's just the number of possibilities with five-person groups :)

<p>The same thing happens with <b>Whatsapp</b>.</p>
<p>Then you download <b>Discord</b>, since that's what younger folks and gamers use.</p>
<p>You probably have <b>Slack</b> still installed because some official organization wanted to use it back when it was cool.</p>
<p>Before you know it, you have <b>WeChat</b> and <b>Line</b> as well.</p>

  Oh, and Google Chat exhibits the same exact issues as Messenger, except that it's work-related topics onlyâ€“except for those groups and DMs that you use to chat about casual topics.
  Sometimes, the messages delete themselves after 24 hours.
  Sometimes, Chat keeps them for 30 days.
  Sometimes, that setting switches back and forth.
  Sometimes, Google seems to want to integrate Chat with GMail.
  Sometimes, Google will release another Chat app (see Allo, Duo, Meet, Messages, Voice,

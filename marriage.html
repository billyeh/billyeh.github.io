Marriage is an absolutely amazing thing.

You commit yourself to another person, for the rest of your life.
You don't know how long the rest of your life will be.
You don't know where you'll want to live for the rest of your life.
You don't know who you'll want to hang out with for the rest of your life.
You don't know where you'll work, what kinds of movies you'll like to watch, or what your health will be like for the rest of your life.

You probably have a better idea of these things than you did, say, five years ago, or 10 years ago.
Maybe you think you have a good idea of these things now–let's say you're 90% sure.
But how many significant things are in our list that could possibly change?
5? 10? 15? 
Let's go with 90%, with just 10 things, and check our odds–oof.
We're looking at a 35% chance that nothing major will change for the rest of our life, after we get married.

Given that, my view of marriage is a little different than it used to be.
There are 8 billion people out there.
Sure, I won't be able to meet all 8 billion.
But I can meet a decent chunk!
Let's say I spend a lot of time meeting people.
The most socially-well-connected people I've seen and known have met thousands of people.
By the time we're thirty, given we are finite in time and space, there are only so many people you could possibly meet.
This is true even if you count swiping on a dating app as an encounter.
Maybe we'll put our upper bound at meeting 10,000 people.
After a while, though, people generally start to look the same anyway.
Let's say that of the 10,000 people you meet, you can put each one into a bucket.
You probably want to marry someone who's closer in proximity too, in time and space
(i.e., someone who grew up across the world in India is much less likely to be a potential partner for you than someone who went to the same high school.
Nothing against India in particular, I could've chosen any country.)

Meeting that many people, whether it's through school, mutual friends, dating apps, or work, gives us a decent chance to find someone we could see ourselves marrying.

But that's where the catch comes in.
There are so many significant things that could change, between when you get married, and the end of your life.
If something major happens, the conventional wisdom is that a split is okay, and at times, necessary.
It's no wonder, then, given the above statistics, we're saddled with such a high divorce rate.

Maybe nothing's wrong with divorce.
But then, is there any point in marrying?
Why not rather all be swingers and just be with whomever we want to be?

On the other hand, we can close that can of worms for a second and assume again for a second that we want to be with the person we're marrying for the rest of our lives.
It's a commitment and intertwining on a level so high I don't see how it could work.

<Insert something about how God wants to marry the church here. Got tired, so I'm done for now.>

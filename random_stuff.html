      <p>No: Your hair looks like Cruella's! Yes: I love your hair; it reminds me of Cruella, which is one of my favorite movies!!</p>
      <p>No: You should really be driving in the carpool lane on the left. Yes: Oh look! The carpool lane there only needs 2 people :)</p>

        Take shoe benches, and the West Elm Hilma (AKA Nora from Schoolhouse, AKA some Vietnamese name on a local website). 
        You either have the bottom-feeding, imported-from-Asia stuff from Wayfair and Amazon ($100+), or pretty top tier stuff (~$1000). 
        We've squeezed the middle out. You either support a high-end shop with its bevy of administration, execs, designers, and 
        marketers–along with the much lower volumes and higher margins required–or settle for mass-produced knock-offs where you pretty 
        much just pay for the materials, shipping, and markup. I haven't worked it out fully yet, but I suspect the math demands these 
        numbers.

        reliance on robots leads to the same bifurcation between processed junk and high-end boutique "hand-made" items.</a> I agree, 
        and it's well underway already.

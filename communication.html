    <p>I hate texting as a medium for communication. One friend once put it this way: it‚Äôs ‚Äúreally low-bandwidth for catching up.‚Äù At best, I type up to 120 words per minute, according to typeracer.com. And for something with simple narrative structure, I can quickly read 100 pages an hour, or 500 words per minute (assuming about 300 words per page). Apparently, the average English word in writing is about 5 letters long. Given that the UTF-8 encoding (including wonderfully information-rich emojis! üòÉ) for characters uses up to 4 bytes per letter, this means that the throughput of communication via text messaging for me is at most about 40 bytes/second upload (i.e. typing) and 166 bytes/second download (i.e. reading).</p>
    <p>Considering the maddeningly slow rate of information exchange via text messaging, to me, it makes no sense that people seem to spend a large chunk of their day pressing (or swiping) buttons on a tiny screen with two fingers in an attempt to have conversations with other people. After several millennia of human evolution and advancement, I can only shake my head in disbelief that this is the zenith we‚Äôve reached.</p>
    <p>I acknowledge that text messaging has its uses, when trying to get an answer to a question that‚Äôs not time-sensitive, or when we need a record of the information written down. Also, many people have a rich, long messaging history with at least one other person or group. Probably that kind of texting chain provides steady, random dopamine hits throughout the day, regardless of the contents.</p>
    <p>An average English speaker apparently speaks about 150 words per minute, or 50 bytes/second. In a normal conversation, upload and download (speaking and listening) take place simultaneously (though asynchronous voice messages are definitely intriguing as well), so we can peg the audio bitrate at 100 bytes/second. This, however, doesn‚Äôt include any of the tonal information of the human voice. Apparently, old-school telephones use an 8kHz sample quantized to 8 bits, which results in a 64,000 bytes/second rate. I‚Äôd be interested to know just how much additional information is contained in the tone of a human voice, but I didn‚Äôt see any studies on that topic (and maybe emojis convey the same information!), so we‚Äôll just say spoken-word information transmission speed is somewhere between 100 and 128,000 bytes/second.</p>
    <p>Speaking might not be much better than texting after all. Fine, humans are limited in the amount of information they can put out and take in. But is that all that makes communicating with people so difficult?</p>
    <p>Slow communication is tolerable. Unfortunately, on top of the low information transmission throughput in our communication channels, there‚Äôs another pernicious factor at play. Even once faithfully transmitted by fault-tolerant, error-correcting machines, word information may have its meaning mangled by the recipient. The phrase ‚Äúwords are inadequate‚Äù really doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe itself.</p>
    <p>In this past year (and who knows how many years in my life before!), I‚Äôve been party to and watched a disturbing number of ‚Äúconversations‚Äù that go absolutely no where. One person‚Äôs mouth moves. Their lips form the requisite vowels; their pitch may undulate wildly, or not at all. The words, spoken, float in the air, waiting. The listener‚Äôs head nods. They may or may not smile. I watch with hopeful anticipation‚Äìfinally, a spark of understanding, responsiveness? Then, the words fall to the ground. Splat! It‚Äôs not even in one ear, out the other. We might as well be talking to walls.</p>
    <p>Set aside the fact that English isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs first language. In fact, I believe this afflicts almost everyone, language-agnostically, even when the words themselves aren‚Äôt difficult to understand. So what‚Äôs going on? To me, there are a few reasons for what I‚Äôll from here on out dub wall-speak.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Imprecise speech. I‚Äôm highly guilty of this. To us, everything we say makes sense. But when speaking, the question we need to ask is, What am I trying to convey? And how should I best convey that to the other person?</li>
      <li>Insufficient common understanding. This happens a lot between people who aren‚Äôt familiar with each other, in combination with imprecise speech. One person has a frame of reference, is living in an N-dimensional world. The other lives in their M dimensions. They need some time to come to a mutual understanding. Take, for example, the sentence ‚ÄúI joke a lot, like too much.‚Äù What one finds a funny joke, another may not. Furthermore, what is too much? Does the speaker simply tell jokes at inopportune moments occasionally (maybe an appropriate jocularity level is 5%, and they tell jokes 10% of the time)? Or are they saying that almost nothing they say can be taken seriously (anywhere between 0 and 80% is acceptable, but they‚Äôre closer to 97%)? To me, it‚Äôs maddening. Left unclarified, the issue here is not just that no information is transmitted, or that it‚Äôs partially transmitted. Even worse, given the myriad of possible meanings, the most likely outcome is that the listener walks away with a completely different idea than the speaker imagined.</li>
      <li>A secondary cause for ‚Äúwall-speak,‚Äù and a contributor to the previous, is a lack of interest in other people. This can explain how wall-speak occurs between even those who have known each other long enough to establish a common undersatanding. It‚Äôs a well-known issue in conversation: one person just waiting their turn for the other to shut their trap so that their trap can open.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As someone who highly values understanding, tends to take an immediate interest in people, and naively assumes the same of others (interpret this statement however you like üòè. Understanding what‚Äìpeople, things? How highly do I value it? Is ‚Äúimmediate‚Äù 5 minutes, a few hours, a day? Am I claiming that I actually do care about people, or is this an really just an ideal I strive for? By care, do I mean I‚Äôm anxious to see them do well? Or do I actually want to take care of them? Which people? Close friends? Strangers? Relatives? Is this statement even true, or am I just straight-out lying, or self-deceived?), after having written this out, I see why wall-speak bothers me so much.</p>
    <p>But there‚Äôs a lot for me to learn, too, especially because I don‚Äôt like the status quo. It turns out thousands of years of evolution hasn‚Äôt emancipated us from craning our necks over screens and torturously twiddling our thumbs on tiny text. It turns out that one solution to words being inadequate is more words. It turns out that aside from the feelings of popularity and being loved that come with a constantly buzzing phone, the sum of worthless words is indeed be more than the sum of the parts.</p>
    <p>Still, I can‚Äôt help but think that things could be more efficient. Less mangling, more mingling. I‚Äôm relieved to know at least one person for whom wall-speak is not an issue. With Him, words are hardly necessary. Don‚Äôt believe me? Just read Matthew 6:7.</p>

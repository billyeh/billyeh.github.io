But now in Christ Jesus you who were once far off have become near in the blood of Christ.  For He Himself is our peace, He who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition, the enmity,  Abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace,  And might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity by it.  And coming, He announced peace as the gospel to you who were far off, and peace to those who were near,  For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.  So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God,  Being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone;  In whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord;  In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.

Be angry, yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation,  Neither give place to the devil.  He who steals should steal no more, but rather should labor, working with his own hands in that which is respectable, that he may have something to share with him who has need.  Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for building up, according to the need, that it may give grace to those who hear.  And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.  Let all bitterness and anger and wrath and clamor and evil speaking be removed from you, with all malice.  And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ also forgave you.  Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;  And walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.  But fornication and all uncleanness or greediness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints,  And obscenity and foolish talking or sly, filthy jesting, which are not becoming, but rather the giving of thanks.  For this you realize, knowing that every fornicator or unclean person or greedy person (who is an idolater) has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.  Let no one deceive you with vain words, for because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience.  Therefore do not be partakers with them;  For you were once darkness but are now light in the Lord; walk as children of light  (For the fruit of the light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth),  Proving what is well pleasing to the Lord.  And do not participate in the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them.  For the things which are done by them in secret it is shameful even to speak of.  But all things which are reproved are made manifest by the light; for everything that makes manifest is light.  Therefore He says, Awake, sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.  Look therefore carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise,  Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.  Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.  And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit,  Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord,  Giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father,  Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ: "}, {"type": "outline", "text": "C.

In the same way the husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his own wife loves himself.  For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church,  Because we are members of His Body.  For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.  This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.

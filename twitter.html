      <p>No: Your hair looks like Cruella's! Yes: I love your hair; it reminds me of Cruella, which is one of my favorite movies!!</p>
      <p>No: You should really be driving in the carpool lane on the left. Yes: Oh look! The carpool lane there only needs 2 people :)</p>

    <h1>Why there is no good furniture</h1>
      <p>
        Take shoe benches, and the West Elm Hilma (AKA Nora from Schoolhouse, AKA some Vietnamese name on a local website). 
        You either have the bottom-feeding, imported-from-Asia stuff from Wayfair and Amazon ($100+), or pretty top tier stuff (~$1000). 
        We've squeezed the middle out. You either support a high-end shop with its bevy of administration, execs, designers, and 
        marketers–along with the much lower volumes and higher margins required–or settle for mass-produced knock-offs where you pretty 
        much just pay for the materials, shipping, and markup. I haven't worked it out fully yet, but I suspect the math demands these 
        numbers.

        Related: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40646446">HN thinks that restaurants' introduction of and increasing 
        reliance on robots leads to the same bifurcation between processed junk and high-end boutique "hand-made" items.</a> I agree, 
        and it's well underway already.

    <h1>Is your quality of life improved by knowing that it could be better in some way, and striving and working to improve it by
      accomplishing that way? Or is it better to not know and be content in ignorance?</h1>
      <p>
        Example: you know that curtains can improve room acoustics and lighting. Now you need curtains. You have to install 
        new curtain rods, buy expensive new curtains, deal with the dust they eventually pick up, and open and close them every day
        or buy expensive robotic solutions to do that which will certainly need fidgeting and charging and finagling to work with
        your smart home system. Or: you live with lesser room acoustics and lighting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: Sometimes it's the people that you care about that hurt you the most. Only when you care too much and expect something
        from others is it possible to get hurt. Is Tennyson right about loving and losing? Is the angst and pain and drama worth it?
        Or is it easier to just live life without caring or expecting too much from other people, so you can make a joke about being
        let down one more time into your grave?

    <h1>Principles</h1>
      <h2>Life is just Pareto. You take stuff, measure it, figure out how to get 80% of it, and move on.</h2>
      <h2>The more you're annoyed by people around you, the more you likely annoy them.</h2>
        <p>Example: "The show also features their neighbors Steve and Marcy Rhoades, both of whom Al finds annoying, but likewise feel the 
          same way about him."
        </p>
        <p>From the <a href="https://archive.is/vawrf">Wikipedia page on Married... with Children, the show with Al Bundy.</a></p>
      <h2>The Jimin Principle</h2>
        <p>In the song <i>Who</i>, Jimin croons, so eloquently, "Is she someone that I see every day? / Is she somewhere a thousand miles away?</p>
        <p>He's stating what I call the Jimin principle, which is that human life is an iterative process of collection and curation.
          You go through cycles in which you <b>collect</b> things, and then when you don't have time, energy, or space for what you have anymore,
          you <b>curate</b> them. This applies to friendships, for example. It also applies to dating. If you consider whether your possible 
          love interest is someone you met and you know already, that demands a very different set of actions (curation) than if you believe
          your love interest lives 1,000 miles away: you should probably move 1,000 miles and start meeting people there (collection)!
